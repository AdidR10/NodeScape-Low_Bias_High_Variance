   - Click on the first node, then click on the second node to create an edge
   - Click "Cancel Edge" to exit edge creation mode
3. **Reposition Nodes**: Drag any node to move it around the canvas

### Running Algorithms

1. **Select Algorithm**: Choose from BFS, DFS (Iterative), or DFS (Recursive) in the dropdown
2. **Choose Start Node**: Select which node to start the traversal from
3. **Run Algorithm**: Click "Run Algorithm" to generate the step-by-step visualization
4. **Control Playback**:
   - ‚ñ∂Ô∏è **Play/Pause**: Start or pause automatic playback
   - ‚èπÔ∏è **Stop**: Reset to the beginning
   - ‚èÆÔ∏è/‚è≠Ô∏è **Step**: Move one step backward or forward
   - **Slider**: Jump to any specific step
   - **Speed Control**: Adjust animation speed (100ms to 2000ms per step)

### Graph Presets

Try different graph structures with one click:
- **Linear**: A simple chain of connected nodes (A-B-C-D-E)
- **Binary Tree**: A complete binary tree structure
- **Complete**: Every node connected to every other node
- **Cycle**: Nodes connected in a circular pattern
- **Star**: One central node connected to all others
- **Grid**: A 2D grid structure

### Advanced Features

- **Context Menus**: Right-click on nodes or edges for delete options
- **Graph Statistics**: Monitor nodes, edges, connectivity, and degree information
- **Algorithm State**: View real-time queue/stack contents and visited nodes
- **Node Selection**: Click nodes to see their degree and neighbor information

## üéØ Algorithm Details

### Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- **Strategy**: Explores nodes level by level using a queue (FIFO)
- **Use Cases**: Shortest path in unweighted graphs, level-order traversal
- **Time Complexity**: O(V + E) where V = vertices, E = edges
- **Space Complexity**: O(V) for the queue and visited set

### Depth-First Search (DFS) - Iterative
- **Strategy**: Explores as far as possible along each branch using a stack (LIFO)
- **Use Cases**: Topological sorting, detecting cycles, pathfinding
- **Time Complexity**: O(V + E)
- **Space Complexity**: O(V) for the stack and visited set

### Depth-First Search (DFS) - Recursive
- **Strategy**: Uses function call stack for recursion
- **Use Cases**: Same as iterative DFS, educational purposes
- **Time Complexity**: O(V + E)
- **Space Complexity**: O(V) for recursion stack

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Application won't start**
   - Ensure Node.js and npm are installed
   - Run `npm install` to install dependencies
   - Check for port conflicts (try a different port with `npm start -- --port 3001`)

2. **Nodes are not visible**
   - Try using a graph preset to load a sample graph
   - Click on empty canvas area to add nodes

3. **Algorithm doesn't run**
   - Ensure you have at least one node in the graph
   - Verify the start node exists in your graph
   - Check browser console for any error messages

4. **Performance issues with large graphs**
   - The visualizer is optimized for graphs with 10-20 nodes
   - For larger graphs, increase animation speed or use step-by-step mode

### Browser Compatibility
- **Recommended**: Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+
- **Minimum**: Any modern browser with ES6+ support
