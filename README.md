### Docker Deployment

#### Option 1: Using Docker Compose (Recommended)
```bash
# Build and run with Docker Compose
docker-compose up --build

# Access the application at http://localhost:3000
```

#### Option 2: Using Docker directly
```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t nodescape-graph-visualizer .

./scripts/deploy.sh --remote           # Use latest remote image
IMAGE_TAG=1.0.5 ./scripts/deploy.sh   # Use specific version
```

### Building for Production

To create a production build:
```bash
npm run build
```

The build folder will contain optimized files ready for deployment.

## üê≥ Docker & CI/CD

### Docker Image

The application is containerized using a multi-stage Docker build:
- **Build Stage**: Uses Node.js 18 Alpine to build the React application
- **Production Stage**: Uses Nginx Alpine to serve the static files

### CI/CD Pipeline

The project includes GitHub Actions for automated CI/CD with dynamic versioning:

1. **Testing**: Runs on every push and pull request
   - Installs dependencies
   - Runs tests
   - Builds the application

2. **Deployment**: Runs on main/dev branch pushes
   - Builds Docker image with dynamic versioning
   - Pushes to Docker Hub with multiple tags
   - Uses GitHub Actions cache for faster builds

### Dynamic Versioning

The CI/CD pipeline automatically generates version numbers based on:
- **Branch**: Determines the major version prefix
- **Run Number**: GitHub Actions run number for the build number

**Version Format**:
- `main` branch: `1.0.{run_number}` (e.g., 1.0.5)
- `dev` branch: `0.1.{run_number}` (e.g., 0.1.3)
- Other branches: `0.0.{run_number}` (e.g., 0.0.2)

**Tags Created**:
- Version tag: `asifmahmoud414/nodescape-graph-visualizer:1.0.5`
- Latest tag: `asifmahmoud414/nodescape-graph-visualizer:latest` (main branch)
- Dev tag: `asifmahmoud414/nodescape-graph-visualizer:dev` (dev branch)

### Docker Hub Deployment

To set up automatic deployment to Docker Hub:

1. **Create Docker Hub Account**: Sign up at [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com)

2. **Create Access Token**: 
   - Go to Account Settings ‚Üí Security
   - Create a new access token

3. **Add GitHub Secrets**:
   - Go to your GitHub repository ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions
   - Add the following secrets:
     - `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME`: Your Docker Hub username
     - `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN`: Your Docker Hub access token

4. **Push to Main Branch**: The CI/CD pipeline will automatically:
   - Build the Docker image
   - Push to `your-username/nodescape-graph-visualizer:latest`

### Pulling from Docker Hub

Once the image is pushed to Docker Hub, anyone can run it:

```bash
# Pull and run the latest image
docker run -d -p 3000:80 asifmahmoud414/nodescape-graph-visualizer:latest

# Run a specific version
docker run -d -p 3000:80 asifmahmoud414/nodescape-graph-visualizer:1.0.5

# Run dev version
docker run -d -p 3000:80 asifmahmoud414/nodescape-graph-visualizer:dev

# Or use docker-compose with the remote image
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d

# Use specific version with environment variables
IMAGE_TAG=1.0.5 docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

## üéØ Algorithm Details

### Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- **Strategy**: Explores nodes level by level using a queue (FIFO)
- **Use Cases**: Shortest path in unweighted graphs, level-order traversal
- **Time Complexity**: O(V + E) where V = vertices, E = edges
- **Space Complexity**: O(V) for the queue and visited set

### Depth-First Search (DFS) - Iterative
- **Strategy**: Explores as far as possible along each branch using a stack (LIFO)
- **Use Cases**: Topological sorting, detecting cycles, pathfinding
- **Time Complexity**: O(V + E)
- **Space Complexity**: O(V) for the stack and visited set

### Depth-First Search (DFS) - Recursive
- **Strategy**: Uses function call stack for recursion
- **Use Cases**: Same as iterative DFS, educational purposes
- **Time Complexity**: O(V + E)
- **Space Complexity**: O(V) for recursion stack

### Common Issues

1. **Application won't start**
   - Ensure Node.js and npm are installed
   - Run `npm install` to install dependencies
   - Check for port conflicts (try a different port with `npm start -- --port 3001`)

2. **Nodes are not visible**
   - Try using a graph preset to load a sample graph
   - Click on empty canvas area to add nodes

3. **Algorithm doesn't run**
   - Ensure you have at least one node in the graph
   - Verify the start node exists in your graph
   - Check browser console for any error messages

4. **Performance issues with large graphs**
   - The visualizer is optimized for graphs with 10-20 nodes
   - For larger graphs, increase animation speed or use step-by-step mode
